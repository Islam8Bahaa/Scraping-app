# Scraping-app

#First Step to let this app work you have to be sure that you have the same environment on your device as installing php and composer and xampp for localhost 

#2nd Step if all are installed go ahead and install composer on the project The Command will be (composer install) after that make new command and install this packages ( composer require fabpot/goutte ) after installing the package time to install npm run command (npm install)

#3rd After install all the packages now we need to make 2 more command after that every thing will be ready first command is to make (php artisan migrate) when you will do this command it will ask you to crate a data base enter yes and it will create a database after that write a command (php artisan serve) it will show up something like this http://127.0.0.1:8000/ this is your local host put remember if you installed the xampp get check if the apache and mysql are running
